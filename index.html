   Angular watches and takes responsibility of the section where ng-app directive is included
   Adding Angular markup to normal HTML is called a 'template' and the browser doesn't understand this template when it reads the code
   Angular has a $compiler which compiles this template into simple browser-readable HTML code called 'view'
  -->
  <h1>Angular is watchful</h1>
  <div ng-app>
    <h1>I work here</h1>
    <h2>{{ 2+5 }}</h2>
  </div>
  <!--
   Angular doesn't compile and process code outside of the ng-app scope. It only watches for Angular expressions, directives, etc inside the scope
   Writing an Angular expression outside the ng-app scope is just like writing any text content
  -->
  <div>
    <h1>But I dont work here</h1>
    <h2>{{ 2+5 }}</h2>
    <p>..psstt..this was because I was out of the ng-app scope</p>
